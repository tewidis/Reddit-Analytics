# /r/disgolf User Preferences Analysis
> Analyzing user disc and brand preferences from reddit.com/r/discgolf

Every year, /r/discgolf surveys its users to find what discs, brands, and
plastics are most popular among its subscribers. These posts can be found at
the following links:

I was curious how users' preferences changed over time as professional
sponsorships change and new discs are released. I viewed this project as a
chance to practice webscraping and creating static and dynamic data
visualizations.
